# Welcome to Yet Another Small Code Retreat #YASCR22

Hello {name},

Thank you for your interest in #YASCR22 üòÄ. 10 people would like to practice coding together on 11/30. Therefore, the
event will surely take place.

With this email you will receive information about the topic of the retreat and the technical requirements.

**IMPORTANT:**

- If you can't attend on 11/30 from 09:00 - 17:15, please inform us early. We would like to take this into account
  during the preparation.

- Optional: If you have a GitHub account, please send us your ID. We will then add you as a contributor to the
  repository for the retreat.

**Topic: Refactoring**

We have chosen the topic "Refactoring" for #YASCR22. We are currently preparing a refactoring kata, which you will work
on in groups. As programming language we have chosen C# (.net 6).

**Technical requirements: Chrome, Zoom.us, screen sharing**.

To participate in the workshop you need at least

- A Chrome browser
- [Zoom.us](https://zoom.us) with permission for screensharing

and optionally

- a [GitHub](https://github.com) account
- a [GitPod](https://gitpod.io) account

For experimentation, we have set up two alternative IDEs that can be used online:

- JetBrains Rider via JetBrains Projector and Google CloudRun.
- And if you have a [GitHub](https://github.com) account, you can also use VisualStudio Code in the browser as IDE
  via [GitPod](https://gitpod.io). For this to work, please send us your GitHub ID in advance so we can add you to the
  repository as a contributor.

Both IDEs can compile and run .net6 projects and tests. For the handover in the group work the git based
[mob.sh](https://mob.sh) is installed.

**What happens next?**

You can follow our preparations on GitHub: https://github.com/small-coding-dojo/yascr22 . Here you can find
detailed information about the technical setup ;-) We will get back to you soon.

We are really looking forward to our first self-hosted code retreat.

Kind regards
Falk, Michael and Stefan

# The day before

Hello {name}!

Tomorrow we will get together to learn and have fun in our code retreat.

We invite you to join us in [zoom](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/89931437006?pwd=VXcxblhEZExKa2lLQ2NXVnBQOENEUT09) already at 8:45, since we would like to start quite on time at 9 o'clock. Please have a current Zoom client installed, since the web client doesn't play well with breakoutrooms and you would not be able to switch rooms on your own. 

Have some coffee or other beverage at hand, maybe some snacks available, so you are well nurtured while we are beginning the day.

We have a [miro workspace](----) prepared, where you could already place a personal picture of you or another type of identifying image [here](--avatar frame link---). Having a picture of you available would be awesome, since we would like to use those as avatars throughout the retreat for example to find working pairs for the excercises.

In case you have a github account and did not share it with us, now would be a good time.

Stay safe, have a good day and see you tomorrow
Stefan, Michael and Falk

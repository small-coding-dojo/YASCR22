# The day before

Hello {name}!

Tomorrow we will get together to learn and have fun in our code retreat.

We invite you to join us in [zoom](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/89931437006?pwd=VXcxblhEZExKa2lLQ2NXVnBQOENEUT09) already at 8:45, since we would like to start quite on time at 9 o'clock. Please have a current [zoom client installed](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/4415294177549-Downloading-the-Zoom-desktop-client-and-mobile-app), since the web client doesn't play well with breakoutrooms and you would not be able to switch rooms on your own. Use the [zoom test meeting](http://zoom.us/test) to check your setup.

Have some coffee or other beverage at hand, maybe some snacks available, so you are well nurtured while we are beginning the day.

We have a miro workspace prepared, where you can place a personal picture of you or another type of identifying image. You will get the link tomorrow in the morning. Having a picture of you available would be awesome, since we would like to use those as avatars throughout the retreat for example to find working pairs for the excercises.

If you are totally new to miro, watch the first video on this page, to get a bit accustomed to the tool:
[Getting Started](https://help.miro.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017571954-How-to-start-collaboration-with-Miro) (3:30 min)

In case you have a [GitHub](https://github.com) account and did not share it with us, now would be a good time: [Send us your GitHub ID](mailto:yascr22@boos.systems?subject=Meine%20GitHub%20ID%20f√ºr%20#YASCR22&body=Meine%20GitHub%20ID%20ist:%20GITHUB%20ID).

Stay safe, have a good day and see you tomorrow
Stefan, Michael and Falk

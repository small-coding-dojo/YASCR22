# Request your GitHub ID for #YASCR22

Good evening {name},

for the upcoming `#YASCR22` Code Retreat we have selected English as the language for both conversations and documentation. 

The remainder of this email is for you, if you feel like creating a GitHub account or if you have one, respectively.

At `#YASCR22` you can work with JetBrains Rider directly in the browser. Additionally, in parts we plan to use Visual Studio Code via [GitPod](https://gitpod.io). Even if you don't want to use this option, you will be able to participate. However, you will miss out on some learning or experience.

In order to use Visual Studio Code and [GitPod](https://gitpod.io), you need a [GitHub ID](https://github.com). Please send it to us.

The following link will create the corresponding email: [Send us your GitHub ID](mailto:yascr22@boos.systems?subject=Meine%20GitHub%20ID%20f√ºr%20#YASCR22&body=Meine%20GitHub%20ID%20ist:%20GITHUB%20ID). You just need to enter your **GitHub ID** and send the **email**.

**Why is it important to us that you can also use Visual Studio Code?

You may feel more comfortable with this alternative IDE than with Rider. In addition, some would like to learn how to set up remote IDEs and use them in training.

**Why do we need your GitHub ID?

At the Code Retreat, you take turns coding. You will push your changes to [GitHub](https://github.com) for the handover of the intermediate status. Our Visual Studio Code solution is based on [GitPod](https://gitpod.io) and requires a [GitHub](https://github.com) account as well as contributor rights for the repository. In the case of the Rider IDE, we can "build in" the permission without requiring a GitHub account. 

Feel free to contact us if you have any questions.

Many greetings,
Michael, Stefan, Falk

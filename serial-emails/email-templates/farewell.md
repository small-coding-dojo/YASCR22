# #YASCR22 Wrap-Up

Dear All,

It was a pleasure to have you at our Code Retreat. Thank you for sharing so much with everyone else and thank you for your valuable feedback.

With this email, we'd like to say good bye for now and send you a copy of the board. Note that your group and mob branches are still present in our #YASCR22 repositories, unless you have deleted them:

- Morning sessions: [Tennis Kata](https://github.com/small-coding-dojo/yascr22-tennis)
- Afternoon sessions: [Tennis Refactoring Golf](https://github.com/small-coding-dojo/yascr22-golf-tennis)

Please remember that all of you are welcome to join our signal group. Here we discuss software crafting topics. Just send a reply with your cell phone number to this email address.

We hope to see you soon at conferences, meetups or the like!

Have a nice week,
Falk, Michael and Stefan

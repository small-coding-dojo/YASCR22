# YASCR22

## What is YASCR22?

YASCR22 is a **remote code retreat**, organized and facilitated by members of the [Small Coding Dojo](https://github.com/small-coding-dojo/) organization.

This particular retreat will **focus more on practicing** and less on teaching.

The topic will be **refactoring**.

You can find more about code retreats in general at the [Code Retreat](https://www.coderetreat.org/the-workshop/) website.
